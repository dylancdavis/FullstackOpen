# FullstackOpen Assignment Submissions

This repository contains by submissions for [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) 2022, a seven-credit course offered by the University of Helsinki. The course is project-oriented, with a focus on the MERN stack. It's split into seven parts:

1. [Introduction to React](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1)
2. [Communicating with a Server](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2)
3. [Creating a backend server with NodeJS & Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)
4. [Backend testing and user authentication](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4)
5. [Frontend testing](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5)
6. [State management](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6)
7. [React router, styling, and Webpack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7)

Each part contains around 20 exercises which either involve creating a project and implementing the features covered in the course material, or adding new features to a project in a previous part. This repository contains all of my completed exercises, organized by part, but since the course is project-oriented and cumulative, only the final product of each part can be viewed. If you wish to see each part at a specific state, check the commit history, which is organized by exercise number.
