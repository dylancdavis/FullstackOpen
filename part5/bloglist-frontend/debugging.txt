Things to note:
- The test only causes issues when a test runs after it
- The test causes no issues when named to a random, nonexistent class
- The test causes issues when giving a possible class, like 'like-button' and 'hidden-list'
- The test "properly" fails when searching an existent, but not visible class

Note that the class does exist in the DOM, it's just not visible.
